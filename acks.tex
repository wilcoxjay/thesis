It takes a village, and without my village, this thesis wouldn't have happened.
My parents, Amy and Brian, always encoraged me to pursue my interests,
  and they put up with seven-year-old me's endless appetite for algebra problems.
I've always looked up to my big brother Sam, even though he's two years younger,
  and to his family, Alexis and Charlie.

Zach: you've been everything I needed in an advisor. I couldn't have done it without you.
And a special thank you for putting so much time into building the lab into what it is today.
To my reading committee members, Dan and Tom, you are both such great role models for how to be an academic.
I learned a ton from watching you work.
To my GSR and friend, Geoffrey, my time in your choir was
some of the only consistent (and much needed) structure to my schedule those first few years in grad school,
and really helped me feel connected to UW and Seattle.

To all the members of the PLSE lab, what an incredible space to learn and hang out!
To Doug, I learned so much from you (and your dad). Thanks for teaching me how to impersonate a systems person.
Thanks to Colin, Konstantin, Pavel, Eric, Stuart, and Calvin for teaching me so much about PL
while disguising it as shooting the breeze.
Also a big thanks to all the incredible UW undergraduates I worked with over the years,
  Steve, Ryan, Pooja, Justin, Miranda, David, Ethan, and Taylor.
You all contributed so much to our projects!

One of the best parts about getting a PhD is becoming a member of the international research community.
I've had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful people and starting great collaborations with several of them.
I met Ilya at the PLDI 2015 banquet, and it wasn't long before we were talking about the basic ideas of \disel.
I met Karl at the ASE 2015 banquet, and it wasn't long before we were talking about Verdi and sensor networks.
I met Oded at PLDI 2016, and it wasn't long before we were working on yet another proof of Raft's correctness.
Oded introduced me to Mooly, Yotam, Sharon, and Marcelo, as well as to Ken and Giuliano.
This entourage has helped me realize that I am a collaborator at heart.
Here's to many more projects together!
